🔄 Step 3: Initialize Git
git init

🧩 Step 4: Connect to Your GitHub Repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/SmritiAwasthi/mini-store-config.git


If the repo is already connected, you'll get a warning — that's okay.

📝 Step 5: Add and Commit Files
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial config files for microservices"

☁️ Step 6: Push to GitHub

Make sure you're on the correct branch (probably main):

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


You’ll be asked to login — either via token or GitHub CLI (recommended).
